Fall Boston Hacks 2017. Our team has decided to work with the Liberty Mutual API to impliment a web application that tells you if it's better to uber, drive or bus to your location depending on where you're going. 

Our algorithm uses metrix's such as Traffic, Safety, Price and Parking availabity to determine a decision.
