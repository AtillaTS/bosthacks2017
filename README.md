Our team used the Liberty Mutual API to implement a web application that recommends the safest and most convenient mode of transport to the user based on 3 parameters: crime safety, weather, and traffic safety. The data queried from the various API's and databases is aggregated and processed in our algorithm, which outputs a final quantitive value on which the transportation recommendation is based.
